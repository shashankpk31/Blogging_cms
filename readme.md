## Authentication system explain.
When the user performs a sign in, this is what happens:

- The client sends a pair of Public Identification and a Private key, usually an email and a password
- The server looks for the user in the database using the email.
- If the user exists in the database, the server hashes the sent password and compares it to the stored hashed password
- If the password is valid, it emits a JSON Web Token (or JWT)
